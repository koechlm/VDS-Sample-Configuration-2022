# VDS-Sample-Configuration-2022
Vault 2022 Data Standard Configuration Sample for Vault Professional (Workgroup)

This configuration sample applies to Vaults based on the default "Manufacturing" behavior configuration. It is also tested in the Vault "PDMC-Sample" environment available for Autodesk Channel Partners. Note - Starting with the Vault 2022 release, another extended sample, "VDS-PDMC-Sample-Configuration-2022," targets advanced VDS feature implementation and Vault API consumption.

I created and maintain this configuration sample as an employee of Autodesk. However, Autodesk does not represent that these samples are reliable, accurate, complete, or otherwise valid in other environments. Accordingly, those configuration samples are provided "as is" with no warranty of any kind, and you use the applications at your own risk.

Sincerely,
Markus Koechl, April 2021
